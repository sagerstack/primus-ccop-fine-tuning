An essential service is a service whose loss would have a debilitating effect on availability in Singapore (examples include electricity, water, healthcare, telecommunications, banking). The distinction is important: CCoP 2.0 applies specifically to CII systems - the computer systems, network components, and end-point devices within the defined digital boundary of the CII. It does not automatically apply to the entire organization. However, according to CSA guidance (RESPONSE-TO-FEEDBACK Q2.2-2.3), CII Owners should consider extending cybersecurity capabilities organization-wide beyond just the CII systems.
