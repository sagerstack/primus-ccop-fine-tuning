name: double-check
description: An easy way to force agent to think again if it's statement that the "Job is done and production ready" is actually done - usually it's not. This skill ensures that that the AI agent verifies their task and user does not have to check after the agent if they did their job.

# When to use
- After a task is completed and before reporting completion details to the user
- After generating tests
- After fixing tests

# Skill
Please double check your work and what you generated. 
- Is it really complete? 
- Did you approach it from different angles? 

Define first at what angles you can approach it. 
Reiterate on the goal and what it means and what is required to achieve it.
Define what "complete" means in this context.

If the task was to generate tests or fix failing tests, run the tests to make sure they are successful. This is the only definition for "complete"

Proceed with the double check only after you are sure you have done all of the above.

Ultrathink!
