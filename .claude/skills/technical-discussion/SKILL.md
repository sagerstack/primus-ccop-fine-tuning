# When To Use
- Use this skill PROACTIVELY when user asks for a technical discussion on a project, requirement or feature scope to implement, or an enhancement to existing requirement

# Examples
Following are some (non-exhaustive) example prompts when this skill should be used: 
 - I want to have a thorough technical discussion about: $ARGUMENTS
 - Enhance the code to implement: $ARGUMENTS
 - Conduct a technical analysis of: $ARGUMENTS
 - Fix the code so that it implements: $ARGUMENTS
 - We need a technical discussion first
 - Analyze the requirement
 - Continue the technical discussion about: $ARGUMENTS

Before proceeding with any implementation or detailed analysis, I need you to gather important context through focused questions. 
Ask me relevant questions to understand my requirements and constraints, ensuring we build the right solution.

Ask questions ONE AT A TIME to keep our discussion focused and efficient. Incrementally build up on the previous questions and ask more detailed questions.

Each question should be tailored to the specific topic and help uncover the technical details needed to move forward effectively.

Start by asking me questions related to $ARGUMENTS to better understand what I'm looking to achieve and how we should approach this together.
