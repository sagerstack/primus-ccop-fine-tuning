# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Build a hybrid model that CII organizations can trust to interpret CCoP 2.0 correctly
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - RAG Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (RAG Infrastructure)
Plan: 1 of 5 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-09 — Completed 01-01-PLAN.md (RAG dependencies and PDF parsing)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 12.5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 10 min
- Total execution time: 0.17 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. RAG Infrastructure | 1/5 | 10 min | 10 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (10min)
- Trend: First plan baseline

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap reordered: RAG Infrastructure first (learning priority), then RAG Eval on 118 cases, then Dataset Expansion, then Re-baseline
- Existing 49.2% baseline (from paper) used as comparison point — no re-run needed before RAG eval
- No LangGraph for dataset generation: plain Python script with structured prompting (critic's recommendation from team research)
- Tier-specific prompt templates for dataset generation (factual, reasoning, safety)
- Multi-source dataset: CIIO practitioner + audit questions + adapted external compliance datasets (NIST, ISO 27001) + existing CCoP datasets
- Hybrid approach (RAG + fine-tuning): RAG for grounding, fine-tuning for reasoning — each addresses different gaps
- 85% accuracy target: Industry standard for compliance automation (Thomson Reuters, GSA references)
- **[01-01] PyMuPDF4LLM for PDF parsing:** Preserves tables and structure better than generic loaders
- **[01-01] Section-level semantic chunking:** 87.7% context recall vs ~65% for fixed-size chunking
- **[01-01] All 8 CCoP documents as standard sections:** RESPONSE-TO-FEEDBACK marked as clarification type
- **[01-01] Databricks settings no defaults:** Forces explicit configuration via .env.local
