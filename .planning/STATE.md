# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Build a hybrid model that CII organizations can trust to interpret CCoP 2.0 correctly
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - RAG Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (RAG Infrastructure)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Context gathered, ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-07 — Roadmap reordered (RAG first), Phase 1 context gathered

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap reordered: RAG Infrastructure first (learning priority), then RAG Eval on 118 cases, then Dataset Expansion, then Re-baseline
- Existing 49.2% baseline (from paper) used as comparison point — no re-run needed before RAG eval
- No LangGraph for dataset generation: plain Python script with structured prompting (critic's recommendation from team research)
- Tier-specific prompt templates for dataset generation (factual, reasoning, safety)
- Multi-source dataset: CIIO practitioner + audit questions + adapted external compliance datasets (NIST, ISO 27001) + existing CCoP datasets
- Hybrid approach (RAG + fine-tuning): RAG for grounding, fine-tuning for reasoning — each addresses different gaps
- 85% accuracy target: Industry standard for compliance automation (Thomson Reuters, GSA references)
