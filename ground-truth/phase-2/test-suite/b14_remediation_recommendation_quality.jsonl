Impact: Reduces attack surface while planning full remediation. (2) Audit current vendor access - Identify all active vendor accounts, Document business justification for each, Disable any unused/orphaned vendor accounts. **Short-term (Month 1-2): MFA Implementation** (3) Deploy MFA for vendor access - Procure app-based MFA solution (Microsoft Authenticator, Duo, Okta), Create individual vendor accounts (e.g., vendor_company_johnsmith, not vendor_admin), Enforce MFA on all vendor remote access, Conduct vendor training on MFA enrollment. Cost: $5-10 per user/month for MFA licensing. (4) Implement vendor access monitoring - Configure SIEM alerts for vendor account authentications, Establish baseline of normal vendor access patterns, Alert on anomalies (off-hours, unusual systems, failed MFA). **Medium-term (Month 3-4): Access Management** (5) Implement just-in-time (JIT) vendor access - Vendor access disabled by default, Vendors request access for specific time periods (e.g., 4-hour maintenance window), Automated access approval workflow, Access automatically revoked after window expires.
