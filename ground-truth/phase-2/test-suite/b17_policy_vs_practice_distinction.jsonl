During audit, evidence shows MFA is configured in the VPN system. However, interviews with 5 system administrators reveal they regularly share MFA bypass codes with each other for convenience during off-hours troubleshooting. How does this affect compliance?", "expected_response": "This is **policy-practice gap resulting in non-compliance** despite documented policy and configured technology. Analysis: **Policy Layer - Adequate:** Written policy exists requiring MFA (meets documentation requirement). **Technology Layer - Configured But Subverted:** MFA is technically enabled in VPN system, BUT bypass mechanism exists (likely 'admin override' or 'emergency access' feature), Bypass codes are being used routinely, not for genuine emergencies. **Practice Layer - Non-Compliant:** Actual operational practice (sharing bypass codes) violates both policy intent and CCoP requirement. This is similar to having door locks but leaving keys under doormat - control exists but is circumvented. **Compliance Assessment:** CCoP auditors assess actual security posture, not documented policies. This would be rated as **Non-Compliant** with findings: (1) MFA is not effectively enforced - Sharing bypass codes negates the 'something you have' factor, Returns to single-factor authentication (shared knowledge), Violates non-repudiation principle (can't identify which admin accessed system). (2) Policy violation culture - Systematic policy violation by administrators suggests: Lack of enforcement/accountability, Possible operational burden (MFA too inconvenient), indicating poor policy design or training gaps. Lack of monitoring (sharing wasn't detected until audit interview). (3) Insider threat risk - Shared bypass codes create untracked privileged access, Any admin with code can access as 'emergency' without accountability. **Root Causes Auditor Would Investigate:** Why do admins bypass MFA? - Genuine operational constraint (e.g., can't get MFA codes at 2 AM)? Inconvenience? Lack of training on proper MFA use? Are bypass codes monitored? How often used? By whom? Are there consequences for bypass code misuse? **Remediation Expectations:** (1) Immediate: Revoke/change current bypass codes, restrict bypass to break-glass procedure with logging and review, (2) Communicate policy violation and consequences to all administrators, (3) Investigate why bypass was felt necessary - improve MFA enrollment/process if needed, (4) Implement monitoring of MFA usage and bypass code usage, (5) Quarterly attestations from admins that they comply with MFA policy. **Auditor Message:** 'Having a written policy and configured technology means nothing if actual practice violates the policy.

What does this reveal and how should auditor assess?", "expected_response": "This reveals **critical gap between documented policy and operational capability**, indicating plan is not internalized or practiced. Analysis: **What This Reveals:** (1) Plan is not familiar to incident response team - 3+ hour delay in even considering CSA notification suggests team hasn't internalized plan requirements, Plan exists as compliance document, not operational guide. (2) Lack of plan integration into exercise - Exercise scenario should have explicit CSA notification trigger point, If facilitator didn't build CSA notification into scenario, suggests organization doesn't routinely practice this critical requirement. (3) No designated responsibility - If entire team discussed for 3 hours without anyone owning CSA notification task, suggests: Roles and responsibilities in plan are unclear or not assigned, No individual accountable for regulatory compliance during incident. (4) Potential real-world outcome - In actual incident, 3-hour notification delay = regulatory violation, Likely CSA enforcement action, Reputational damage ('why did CIIO delay notifying regulator?'). **Compliance Assessment:** Auditor would rate this as **Significant Finding** despite having documented 2-hour policy: (1) Plan exists but isn't effective (team doesn't follow it under simulated pressure), (2) Training gap - team unfamiliar with plan content, (3) Exercise design gap - CSA notification should be scenario trigger, not after-thought. **Deeper Issues Auditor Would Investigate:** - Has incident response team received training on the plan? - Is there a checklist/playbook guiding team through incident steps including CSA notification? - Who has CSA contact information? (If no one knows who to call, 2-hour timeline is impossible), - Has team ever successfully demonstrated CSA notification in prior exercises? **Remediation Requirements:** (1) Immediate: Revise plan to include explicit decision tree: 'If criteria X, Y, Z met \u2192 immediately notify CSA (within 2 hours)', Create CSA notification checklist (what information to provide, contact info, escalation), Assign clear role: 'CISO responsible for CSA notification' (not 'team will handle it'). (2) Re-training: Conduct focused training session on CSA notification requirements, Provide wallet cards/quick reference with CSA contact info. (3) Re-test: Conduct another tabletop within 30 days specifically testing CSA notification, Success criteria: Team triggers notification decision within 1 hour of incident confirmation. (4) Continuous improvement: Include 'time to CSA notification decision' as exercise metric, Track and improve over time. **Auditor Message:** 'Your documented plan says 2 hours.

Assessment: **Compliance Status - Technically Meets Requirement:** Training records show 100% completion, satisfying CCoP 2.0 documentation requirement. Policy exists and is tracked. From pure audit checklist perspective: \u2713 Policy exists, \u2713 Training provided, \u2713 Completion tracked. **Effectiveness Status - Fails Intent:** Actual awareness (intent of requirement) is not achieved. Employees don't retain information, suggesting: Training is checkbox exercise, not educational, Content may not be engaging or relevant, No knowledge verification (tests/assessments), No consequences for non-engagement. **Audit Finding Spectrum:** *Strict interpretation:* Minor observation - technically compliant but effectiveness questioned. *Intent-based interpretation:* Moderate finding - training exists but doesn't achieve security awareness objective. **Factors Affecting Severity:** - If training includes knowledge checks/quizzes: Employees passing quizzes without retention suggests quiz design is poor (too easy, questions give answers). Higher severity. - If training is pure video with no assessment: Lower expectations for retention, but still concerning. - If interviews reveal employees cannot identify basic threats (phishing examples, social engineering): Critical gap - training completely ineffective. **Root Causes:** (1) Training quality: Generic, boring content not tailored to CII context, Too long or too short, No interactive elements or scenarios. (2) Organizational culture: Leadership treats training as compliance burden, not security investment, 'Just get it done' messaging instead of emphasizing importance. (3) No reinforcement: Annual one-time training without ongoing security messaging, No simulated phishing tests, No follow-up. (4) No accountability: Employees know there's no consequence for minimal engagement, Just need to show completion, not demonstrate knowledge. **Remediation Recommendations:** (1) Improve training quality: Shorten modules (10-15 min max), Add CII-specific scenarios relevant to employee roles, Include knowledge checks after each module (must pass to progress), Require minimum viewing time (can't skip through). (2) Knowledge verification: Add post-training quiz (80% pass required), Failed quiz = remedial training required, Track quiz scores, not just completion. (3) Ongoing reinforcement: Monthly security tips/reminders, Simulated phishing tests (quarterly), Security awareness in team meetings. (4) Measure effectiveness: Not 'completion rate' but 'phishing click rate reduction', 'security incident reporting increase', 'policy violation decrease'. (5) Executive sponsorship: Leadership messaging that security awareness is critical, Share incident examples (anonymized) showing why training matters. **Auditor Perspective:** 'You've achieved 100% training completion but zero awareness improvement.
