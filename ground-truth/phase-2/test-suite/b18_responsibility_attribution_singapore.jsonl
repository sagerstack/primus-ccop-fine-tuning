CIIO Responsibilities**: Provide detailed information about their IT/OT architecture, system interdependencies, and operational requirements, Propose which systems should be within the digital boundary based on criticality to essential service delivery, Explain technical and operational constraints, Implement security controls for systems within the agreed digital boundary. **2. CSA Responsibilities**: Assess the CIIO's proposed boundary from a cybersecurity risk perspective, Identify systems that should be included to ensure comprehensive CII protection, Consider attack vectors, interdependencies, and potential compromise paths, Ensure consistency in boundary definitions across similar CIIs, **Make final determination** on the digital boundary in consultation with Sector Lead and CIIO. **3.

Can a CIIO refuse CSA access to certain systems?", "expected_response": "**CSA's Audit and Inspection Powers (Section 19)**: The Commissioner (through CSA auditors) has extensive powers to ensure CII security and CCoP compliance: (1) **Access Powers**: Right to access CII systems, facilities, and premises at reasonable times (with or without prior notice depending on circumstances), Inspect CII systems, networks, security controls, and configurations, Access logs, documentation, policies, and security records. (2) **Information Gathering Powers**: Require CIIO to provide information, documents, and explanations, Interview personnel (designated person, security staff, system administrators), Request demonstrations of security controls and incident response procedures, Review third-party contracts and vendor assessments. (3) **Technical Assessment Powers**: Conduct vulnerability assessments (though typically with CIIO coordination to avoid disruption), Review security architecture and network segmentation, Test security controls (authentication, logging, backups, etc.), Observe operational security practices. **CIIO's Corresponding Obligations**: Under the Act, CIIOs **must**: (1) Provide CSA auditors with access to CII systems and facilities, (2) Cooperate with audit requests and provide requested information in a timely manner, (3) Make personnel available for interviews, (4) Facilitate CSA's inspection activities, (5) Not obstruct or hinder CSA's audit work. **Can CIIO Refuse CSA Access?**: **Generally, no.** CSA's powers under Section 19 are statutory, meaning: Refusal to provide access or cooperate is an **offense under the Act**, punishable by fine (up to $100,000) and potential criminal prosecution for individuals who obstruct. CIIOs cannot invoke privacy, commercial confidentiality, or operational inconvenience as grounds to refuse CSA access to CII systems within the digital boundary. **Limited Exceptions/Accommodations**: (1) **Operational Safety**: For safety-critical OT systems, CIIO can request CSA conduct inspection during maintenance windows or use alternative assessment methods (e.g., review configurations offline rather than live testing). CSA will typically accommodate reasonable safety concerns, but CIIO cannot use this to indefinitely delay access. (2) **Privileged Information**: Legal professional privilege may apply to legal advice documents, but does not extend to technical systems or most security documentation. (3) **Third-Party Systems**: If CII includes third-party systems (cloud services, MSSP tools), CIIO must still facilitate CSA access. CIIO should ensure contracts with third parties allow for regulatory audits. **Non-CII Systems**: CSA's statutory powers apply to CII within the digital boundary. CIIO could potentially decline access to non-CII corporate systems (e.g., HR systems, general office IT) that are outside the digital boundary, though CSA may ask for information about these systems if they interconnect with CII. **Practical Approach**: CIIOs should: Maintain clear digital boundary documentation so scope of CSA's access is well-defined, Prepare for audits by maintaining documentation and ensuring staff understand CSA's audit authority, Communicate proactively with CSA if there are operational constraints, Designate personnel to coordinate CSA audit logistics. **Consequences of Refusal**: If CIIO refuses CSA access without legitimate safety justification: Criminal offense under the Act with financial penalties, CSA may obtain warrant or court order compelling access, Enforcement escalation (cybersecurity directions, prosecution), Reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny. **Bottom Line**: CSA has **broad statutory powers** to audit CII.

The parent company has global cybersecurity policies and wants to centralize all security operations in their overseas Security Operations Center. From a Singapore regulatory perspective, who is responsible for CCoP 2.0 compliance - the Singapore subsidiary (CIIO), the overseas parent company, or both? Can the CIIO delegate responsibility to the parent company?", "expected_response": "**The Singapore subsidiary (as the designated CIIO) bears full regulatory responsibility**, not the overseas parent company. The CIIO cannot transfer or delegate this responsibility to the parent. **Legal Framework**: (1) **Designation is Entity-Specific**: Under Section 7 of the Cybersecurity Act, the Commissioner designates a specific **legal entity** as the CIIO (the Singapore subsidiary). The designation notice is issued to that entity and specifies the owner of the CII. (2) **Compliance Obligation**: Section 11 requires **every CIIO** to comply with applicable codes of practice. This obligation attaches to the designated legal entity (Singapore subsidiary), not to its parent company or corporate group. (3) **Singapore Jurisdiction**: The Cybersecurity Act is Singapore legislation. It regulates entities and systems in Singapore. The Commissioner's authority does not extend to overseas parent companies except where they own systems in Singapore and are designated as CIIO. **Scenario Analysis**: **Who is Responsible**: Singapore subsidiary (CIIO) - has **full regulatory responsibility** to comply with CCoP 2.0 and Cybersecurity Act, Parent company - **no direct regulatory obligation** to Singapore (unless also designated as CIIO for its own Singapore systems), CSA regulates the Singapore CIIO, not the corporate group. **Can CIIO Use Parent Company's Global SOC?**: Yes, the CIIO **can use** parent company's overseas SOC for security operations, **but this does not transfer regulatory responsibility**. This is equivalent to hiring a third-party MSSP (see B18-005). **CIIO Remains Responsible For**: Ensuring parent company's global policies meet or exceed CCoP 2.0 requirements for Singapore CII, Overseeing parent company's SOC to ensure adequate monitoring of Singapore CII, Reporting incidents to CSA (CIIO reports, not parent company), Ensuring audit findings are addressed, Compliance with cybersecurity directions from Commissioner. **Key Risks in Centralized Model**: (1) **Policy Conflicts**: Parent company's global policies may not fully align with CCoP 2.0 Singapore-specific requirements (e.g., CSA incident reporting timelines, Singapore data residency considerations). CIIO must ensure Singapore requirements are met, even if this means supplementing global policies. (2) **Incident Reporting**: If parent company's global SOC detects incident affecting Singapore CII, **CIIO must still report to CSA** within required timelines (2 hours). CIIO cannot say 'our parent company handles incident reporting globally.' (3) **Audit and Inspection**: CSA audits the Singapore CIIO. CSA may request access to parent company's SOC, documentation, or personnel as part of auditing the CIIO's compliance. If parent company refuses to cooperate, CSA will hold the **Singapore CIIO** accountable for non-cooperation. (4) **Enforcement**: If compliance failures occur, CSA's enforcement actions (fines, directions, prosecution) will be against the **Singapore CIIO**, not the overseas parent company. **CIIO's Governance Obligations**: To manage this structure compliantly, the Singapore CIIO should: (1) Ensure written agreements with parent company clearly specify CCoP 2.0 requirements for Singapore CII, (2) Maintain oversight and visibility into parent company's SOC operations for Singapore systems, (3) Designate a Singapore-based designated person with authority to ensure compliance (not an overseas executive), (4) Conduct independent validation that parent company's controls meet CCoP requirements, (5) Have contingency plans if parent company changes policies or reduces support, (6) Ensure parent company will cooperate with CSA audits and provide information as needed. **Who CSA Interacts With**: CSA's primary regulatory relationship is with the **Singapore CIIO** (subsidiary), CSA may request information about parent company's controls as part of assessing CIIO's compliance, But CSA holds the Singapore CIIO accountable, not the parent. **Bottom Line**: Corporate group structure does not change regulatory responsibility. The **designated CIIO** (Singapore subsidiary) remains fully responsible for CCoP 2.0 compliance regardless of: Ownership structure, Global security operations centralization, Group-wide policies.
