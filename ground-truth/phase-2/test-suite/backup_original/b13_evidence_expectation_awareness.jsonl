Auditor may request live demonstration of attempting remote access to verify MFA prompt appears. (2) User Enrollment Evidence - List of all users with remote CII access showing MFA enrollment status. Auditors expect 100% enrollment for users with active access. Reports from MFA system (e.g., Azure MFA, Okta, Duo) showing enrollment dates. (3) Authentication Logs - Sample authentication logs showing successful MFA authentications including: username, timestamp, first factor (password) result, second factor (token/app) result, and access granted/denied outcome. Logs should demonstrate MFA is actually being used, not just configured. (4) Policy Documentation - Written policy stating MFA is required for remote access, what MFA methods are acceptable (app-based, hardware token), and process for MFA enrollment/exceptions. (5) Exception Management - If any exceptions exist (emergency access, specific users), documentation of: exception justification, approving authority, compensating controls, and exception review/expiry dates. Auditors rarely accept 'no exceptions' claim without evidence. (6) User Communication Evidence - Training materials or communications sent to users explaining MFA requirement, enrollment process, and support contacts. Shows organizational awareness of the requirement. (7) Testing Evidence - Results from penetration testing or vulnerability assessments specifically validating that remote access without MFA is blocked. (8) Vendor Documentation - If using third-party MFA solution, licensing evidence showing active subscription and sufficient licenses for all users. Evidence quality matters: Screenshots can be faked, so auditors prefer system-generated reports with timestamps.

Auditor may request screenshot or configuration export with timestamps. (2) Storage Capacity Evidence - Storage utilization reports showing sufficient capacity exists for 1-year retention at current log generation rates. If 90-day storage is 500GB, auditor expects evidence of ~2TB total allocated. Insufficient storage = inability to meet requirement. (3) Historical Access Test - Auditor will request logs from specific dates to test: (a) Recent date (within 90 days) - must be retrieved in seconds/minutes (immediate access), (b) Old date (6-12 months ago) - must be retrievable, even if takes longer (proving 1-year retention), (c) Multiple random dates - to verify retention is consistent, not just for audit preparation. (4) Integrity Protection Evidence - Technical controls preventing log tampering: Role-based access controls showing limited users can delete logs, Audit trail of log system access showing who accessed logging infrastructure and when, Write-once-read-many (WORM) storage configuration if applicable, Cryptographic hashing/signing of log files proving they haven't been altered. (5) Retention Validation Reports - Automated reports from log management system showing: oldest log date (should be ~365 days ago), total log count/size per month (showing continuous collection), and gaps in retention (should be none). (6) Access Rights Matrix - Documentation showing which personnel have access to logs (read vs modify vs delete), approval for these access rights, and quarterly access reviews proving principle of least privilege. (7) Procedure Documentation - Written procedures for: Log archival process (hot to cold storage), Log deletion process (after 1 year), Log restoration process (from archive), and backup of logging infrastructure. (8) Incident Investigation Evidence - Examples of past incident investigations where logs were successfully used, demonstrating operational capability to access and use retained logs. (9) Backup Evidence - Logs should be backed up separately from source systems to prevent log loss from system failure or ransomware. Auditor expects log backup documentation. Critical Test: Auditor may request 'live retrieval' of 8-month-old logs during audit to verify retention and accessibility claims are real, not just documented.", "evaluation_criteria": {"completeness": "Should identify configuration, capacity, testing, integrity, and access control evidence", "accuracy": "Must include the 'live test' element that auditors actually perform", "depth": "Should explain what each evidence type proves (retention vs accessibility vs integrity)", "specificity": "Should provide concrete examples (storage calculations, date-based retrieval tests)"}, "metadata": {"domain": "IT/OT", "criticality": "high", "evidence_category": "data_retention", "evaluation_method": "llm_judge"}}

This proves exercise occurred. (2) Exercise Report - After-action report documenting: Timeline of simulated incident and team responses, Decisions made and rationale, Communications tested (internal, CSA notification, public), Issues identified during exercise, Strengths demonstrated, Gaps or failures observed. Report should be dated and approved by management. (3) Lessons Learned / Improvement Plan - Critical evidence linking testing to improvement: List of gaps identified during exercise, Remediation actions with owners and deadlines, Tracking of remediation completion, Examples: 'Contact list for legal team was outdated - updated within 1 week', 'CSA notification procedures were unclear - procedures rewritten and validated'. (4) Plan Version Control - Incident response plan with: Version history showing updates over time, Dates of revisions, Summary of changes (linking back to exercise lessons learned), Approval signatures showing management review. This proves plan is 'living document', not static. (5) Annual Testing Schedule - Multi-year view showing: Previous exercises (2-3 years back), Planned future exercises, Different scenarios tested (not same scenario every year). Demonstrates systematic approach to testing. (6) Training Evidence - Sign-in sheets or completion records showing incident response team members were trained on updated procedures after plan revisions. (7) Real Incident Correlation - If actual incidents occurred between exercises, evidence that: Incident was reviewed for lessons learned, Plan was updated based on real incident experience, Updates were communicated to team. (8) Board/Executive Reporting - Evidence that exercise results and plan updates were reported to board/executive leadership, demonstrating governance oversight. Red Flag for Auditors: If plan shows same version number for 2+ years despite annual testing requirement, auditor knows testing isn't driving improvement or testing didn't happen.", "evaluation_criteria": {"completeness": "Should cover exercise documentation, after-action report, lessons learned, plan updates, and tracking", "accuracy": "Must include evidence of improvement loop (test → findings → updates), not just test occurrence", "audit_realism": "Should mention version control and multi-year view that auditors actually check", "insight": "Should identify 'red flags' auditors look for (static plan, no improvements)"}, "metadata": {"domain": "IT/OT", "criticality": "high", "evidence_category": "testing_documentation", "evaluation_method": "llm_judge"}}
