Residual risks include: (1) MFA fatigue attacks - Attackers spam user with MFA push notifications hoping user approves accidentally or out of annoyance. Recent attacks (Uber, Okta) exploited this. Mitigation: Use number-matching MFA instead of simple approve/deny. (2) MFA device compromise - If attacker steals user's phone/hardware token, both factors compromised. Especially risky if users use personal devices for work MFA. Mitigation: Device management policies, remote wipe capability. (3) Session hijacking post-authentication - MFA validates initial login, but if attacker hijacks session after authentication (via malware, network attack), MFA doesn't protect. Mitigation: Continuous authentication, short session timeouts. (4) Social engineering MFA bypass - Sophisticated phishing can trick users into providing MFA codes to fake login pages. Attacker uses code in real-time. Mitigation: User training, FIDO2/WebAuthn (phishing-resistant MFA). (5) Recovery/reset procedures - MFA reset processes (for lost devices) often weaker than MFA itself. Attackers social engineer helpdesk to reset MFA. Mitigation: Strong identity verification for MFA resets. (6) Insider threat - MFA prevents external unauthorized access but doesn't prevent malicious insiders who have legitimate credentials and MFA. Mitigation: Privileged access monitoring, user behavior analytics. (7) Local console access - MFA typically applies to remote/network access. Physical console access may bypass MFA if not controlled. Mitigation: Physical security, console access logging. Therefore: MFA is critical control but must be part of defense-in-depth, not sole security measure. Residual risks require additional controls: monitoring, training, session management, physical security.", "evaluation_criteria": {"completeness": "Should identify multiple residual risk categories: MFA fatigue, device theft, session hijacking, social engineering, insider threat", "accuracy": "Must acknowledge MFA value while identifying realistic remaining risks", "practicality": "Should suggest mitigations for each residual risk, not just identify problems", "insight": "Should emphasize defense-in-depth principle"}, "metadata": {"domain": "IT/OT", "criticality": "medium", "risk_category": "access_control", "evaluation_method": "expert_rubric"}}

Attackers can abuse these legitimate paths. Example: Malware in permitted data flow from OT to IT historian. Mitigation: Deep packet inspection at boundary, application-layer filtering. (2) Removable media vectors - Segmentation protects network paths, but USB drives, laptops moved between IT/OT bypass network controls. Common in industrial environments for PLC programming, maintenance. Mitigation: USB device controls, media scanning, strict removable media policy. (3) OT-originated threats - Segmentation mainly protects OT from IT compromise, but doesn't protect against threats originating in OT: Malicious OT vendor with physical access, Compromised OT devices (if vendor ships pre-infected), Insider threat with OT access. Mitigation: Vendor management, supply chain security, OT endpoint protection. (4) Weak authentication within OT - Many legacy OT systems lack authentication or use default/shared passwords. Segmentation doesn't fix weak OT internal security. Mitigation: OT-specific security hardening, industrial endpoint protection. (5) Wireless and cellular backdoors - OT systems sometimes have undocumented wireless modems or cellular connections (for vendor remote support). These bypass segmentation. Mitigation: Wireless scanning, network discovery, vendor access management. (6) Firewall misconfiguration - Over time, firewall rules accumulate exceptions ('temporary' rules that become permanent). Eventually, segmentation weakens. Mitigation: Quarterly rule review, automated rule expiry, change justification documentation. (7) Zero-day vulnerabilities in OT systems - Segmentation limits exposure but doesn't patch vulnerable OT systems. Zero-days can still be exploited via permitted traffic or other vectors. Mitigation: Virtual patching (IPS signatures), OT vulnerability monitoring. (8) Physical access - Segmentation is logical control. Physical access to OT facility bypasses all network security. Mitigation: Physical security (access control, surveillance, visitor management). (9) Safety system separation - Segmentation typically doesn't separate control systems from safety systems. Control system compromise could impact safety. Mitigation: Additional segmentation within OT (safety network isolation). Therefore: Segmentation creates defensible architecture but requires complementary controls for comprehensive OT protection.", "evaluation_criteria": {"completeness": "Should identify network bypass vectors (removable media, wireless), internal OT weaknesses, physical access, operational risks", "depth": "Should explain why each risk persists despite segmentation", "accuracy": "Must recognize segmentation as critical but insufficient sole control", "practicality": "Should provide specific mitigations, especially OT-appropriate solutions"}, "metadata": {"domain": "OT", "criticality": "high", "risk_category": "network_architecture", "evaluation_method": "expert_rubric"}}

Blind spots remain in coverage. Mitigation: Continuous inventory of systems, prioritize critical system log integration. (2) Alert fatigue and false positives - SIEM generates high volume of alerts. Security team may miss critical alerts in noise. Studies show 50-70% of alerts are false positives. Mitigation: Continuous tuning, machine learning for anomaly detection, clear escalation for high-priority alerts. (3) Encrypted traffic blind spot - SIEM monitors logs, not network traffic. Encrypted communication (TLS/SSL) hides malicious activity in network payload. Mitigation: TLS inspection, endpoint detection, network behavior analytics. (4) Zero-day and unknown attacks - Signature-based detection misses novel attack techniques not in known threat database. Advanced attackers use custom tools avoiding detection. Mitigation: Behavior-based analytics, threat hunting, anomaly detection. (5) Delayed detection - SIEM provides faster detection than manual log review, but sophisticated attacks may still go undetected for weeks/months (industry average: 200+ days). Mitigation: Threat hunting programs, continuous monitoring, red team exercises. (6) Insider threats using legitimate access - Insider using authorized credentials for unauthorized purposes generates 'normal-looking' logs. Hard to distinguish malicious from legitimate behavior. Mitigation: User behavior analytics (UEBA), privileged access monitoring. (7) Log manipulation before collection - If attacker compromises system before logs are forwarded to SIEM, they can delete evidence before it's centralized. Mitigation: Real-time log forwarding (sub-second), log integrity verification. (8) SIEM availability - SIEM is single point of failure for detection. If SIEM fails or is attacked, detection capability lost. Mitigation: SIEM high availability, backup log collection. (9) Skills gap - SIEM is tool requiring skilled analysts. Without expertise, alerts go uninvestigated, patterns go unrecognized. Mitigation: Training, managed SOC services, playbooks. Therefore: SIEM dramatically improves detection posture but requires skilled operation, continuous tuning, and complementary controls (endpoint detection, network monitoring, threat intelligence) for comprehensive coverage.", "evaluation_criteria": {"completeness": "Should identify coverage gaps, alert fatigue, encrypted traffic, zero-days, delayed detection, insider threats, skills gaps", "accuracy": "Must recognize SIEM improves but doesn't perfect detection", "balance": "Should acknowledge SIEM value while identifying real limitations", "mitigations": "Should provide practical approaches to reduce residual risks"}, "metadata": {"domain": "IT/OT", "criticality": "medium", "risk_category": "detection_response", "evaluation_method": "expert_rubric"}}
